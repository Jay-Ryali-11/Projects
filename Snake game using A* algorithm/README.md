# Snake-Game-Using-A*-algorithm

Overview:
This project is a classic implementation of the Snake Game using Java and the Swing GUI library. The game includes core mechanics such as snake movement, apple generation, collision detection, and game over conditions. Notably, it utilizes an A* algorithm for intelligent apple generation, enhancing the gameplay experience. The user interface is designed with Swing components, ensuring a visually appealing and interactive gaming experience.

Main Classes:
SnakeGame.java:

Entry point for the game.
Creates an instance of the GameFrame class to initialize the game window.
GameFrame.java:

Extends JFrame to create the game window.
Adds a GamePanel to the frame for rendering the game.
GamePanel.java:

Extends JPanel and implements ActionListener for game logic and rendering.
Manages snake movement, apple generation, collision detection, and game over conditions.
Utilizes a timer for game updates and rendering.
Key Features:
Intelligent Apple Generation: Implements an A* algorithm to find the closest valid position for generating apples, enhancing the gameplay dynamics.
User Interface: Utilizes Swing components to create a user-friendly and visually appealing game interface.
Scalability and Customization: The code is designed for scalability and customization, allowing for easy modification and extension of game features.
Enhanced Gameplay: Offers a fun and engaging gaming experience with potential for further improvements and enhancements.
Methods Used:
move(): Controls the snake's movement based on user input.
checkApple(): Checks if the snake has eaten an apple and updates the game accordingly.
checkCollisions(): Detects collisions with the snake's own body or the game boundaries.
generateAppleWithAStar(): Utilizes the A* algorithm to intelligently generate apples on the game board.
gameOver(): Displays the game over screen and final score when the game ends.
Outcomes:
Developed a fully functional Snake Game with intelligent apple generation using the A* algorithm.
Demonstrated core game development concepts including game logic, user interface design, and algorithmic intelligence.
Provided a fun and engaging gaming experience with potential for further enhancements and customization.
